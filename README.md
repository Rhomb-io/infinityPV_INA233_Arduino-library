[*LiBAT5V2A Multiplatform *](https://www.infinitypv.com) 


This is an Arduino IDE library for monitoring voltage/current at different points in the infinityPV LiBAT5V2A evaluation board
through the INA219 ADCs on board. However, you can use the library for your own designs including INA219 ADCs :).  

Repository Contents
-------------------

* **/examples** - Example sketches for the library (.ino). Run these from the Arduino IDE. 
* **/extras** - Additional documentation for the user. These files are ignored by the IDE. 
* Source files for the library (.cpp, .h). 
* **library.properties** - General library properties for the Arduino package manager.
